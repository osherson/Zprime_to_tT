# Zprime_to_tT
Z' search with top and heavy top


## Files starting with TT_ pertain to the TTBAR estimate
  TemplateMaker makes the theta feed for the tamplate morphing
  TemplateMorpher does the obivous: morphs the templates. (need to be run in a theta repository containing the output of the above)
  TemplateChecker checks the results of the above in the ttbar region
  TemplateCheckerHeavy checks how the new shapes perform in the heavy(er) top region.
## NT_ for non-top
## SR for signal region plotters
